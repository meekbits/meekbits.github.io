<h3>Security</h3>
The App stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Company, in order to provide the Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the App secure. The Company therefore recommends that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the App won’t work properly or at all.
<h3>Charges</h3>
The Company is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, it reserves the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. The Company will never charge you for the App or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
<h3>Internet Connection</h3>
If you’re using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still Apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third party charges. In using the App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the App, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App.
